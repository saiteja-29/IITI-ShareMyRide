# Description
IITI_ShareMyRide is a car pooling software application for the IIT Indore Community which is useful for people travelling towards the same destination   
Carpooling, also known as ride-sharing, is a transportation model where
individuals share a vehicle for their commute or travel. In carpooling, a driver
with a private vehicle picks up passengers who are heading in the same
direction or to the same destination and shares the ride with them. Carpooling
can be organized through various means, such as social media, websites, mobile
apps, or even bulletin boards. The main goal of carpooling is to reduce the
number of single-occupancy vehicles on the road, which helps to reduce traffic
congestion, decrease carbon emissions, and save fuel costs. Carpooling can also
provide a more social and cost-effective mode of transportation for individuals
who may not have access to public transportation or prefer not to drive alone
.
Carpooling can be structured in various ways, such as formal or informal
arrangements, with or without payment, and can be organized for regular or
occasional travel. Carpooling can be implemented in various settings, including
corporate, educational, and residential areas, and can involve carpooling with
co-workers, classmates, or strangers. Overall, carpooling offers a sustainable
and convenient transportation option that benefits both the environment and
individuals.
